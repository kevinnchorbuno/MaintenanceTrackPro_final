# MaintenanceTrackPro

## Overview

MaintenanceTrackPro is a web-based application designed to streamline equipment management and maintenance for industrial or facility teams. It helps track equipment health, schedule maintenance, log issues, and manage user roles (boss, admin, engineer) to ensure operational efficiency and reduce downtime.

*A software made by a current student in UMaT, Ghana to improve the equipment maintenance handling practices in factories.*

## Features

- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Tailored views for bosses, admins, and engineers.
- **Equipment Management**: Add, view, and manage equipment details along with QR code integration for quick access.
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Schedule and log maintenance tasks efficiently.
- **Health Monitoring**: Visual display of equipment health (randomly generated between 60-100%) using graphs.
- **Notifications**: Report issues and receive alerts.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Quickly access equipment details via QR codes.

## How It Works

- **app.py**: Initializes the Flask application, configures the SQLite database, sets up file uploads, and validates image formats.
- **routes.py**: Defines the URL endpoints and logic for user authentication (login/logout), dashboard views, equipment addition, and more.
- **models.py**: Contains the database models, including Users, Equipment, Maintenance, and Notifications.
- **Templates**: HTML files (e.g., `engineer_dashboard.html`) render the user interfaces and display dynamic content such as equipment health graphs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MaintenanceTrackPro.git
   cd MaintenanceTrackPro
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file, then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Setup:**

   If your project uses Flask-Migrate or similar tools, set up your database by running the appropriate migration commands (e.g., `flask db upgrade`).

## Running the Application Locally

1. Activate your virtual environment if not already activated:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the application.

## Deployment on PythonAnywhere

1. **Create a New Web App** on PythonAnywhere, selecting Flask as the framework.
2. **Clone Your Repository** using a Bash console:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MaintenanceTrackPro.git
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** on PythonAnywhere and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd MaintenanceTrackPro
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the WSGI File** to point to your Flask app (ensure the path is correct).
5. **Reload Your Web App** from the PythonAnywhere dashboard.

For more details, see the [PythonAnywhere Flask deployment guide](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Flask/).
